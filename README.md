# The Code Gloss
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
The purpose is to practice React since I didn't work with it since October 2021.

## Why code gloss ?
I take many notes while working, sometimes a link, a word, a notion, a quote related to my everyday developer practice. 
But it is all about papers, notebooks, a public and a private TIL, and, well, I tried evernote, joplin, zetllr, mind maps, in french or english, and various tools and those are different sources of truth. 

:gem: So my goal is a definitive code glossary, the code gloss. :gem:

This is a work in progress, maybe I will found one day the ultimate methodology to take notes.
My favorite is a simple markdown file now, my own property (exporting files from one tool to another is sometimes a nightmare or a time devourer)

So, the code gloss will be a simple form for the moment.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
